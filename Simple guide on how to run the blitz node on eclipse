Tip : Always run Ubuntu on administrator to avoid errors
Balance : maintain atleast 0.0055 eth in Eclipse mainnet
Req: Laptop or PC (higher the spec = higher the reward), 0.0055 eth and 30 mins of your time.


let's get started ->

1. Open command prompt (right click and run as admin)

wsl --install   (run this command it will take some time to install and if asked for password input your preferred password)

after successful installation -> restart your computer

now search "ubuntu" in search bar and run it as administrator.

2. Install Rust

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

wait for few mins

3. Install Solana CLI

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash

this will take sometime so don't panic and wait until it finish.

after successful installation you'll get output like this -
